# Using GIS to assess equitable recreation access in the American West
This repository holds the Python Jupyter notebooks for my capstone project for a master's degree in Environmental Observation and Informatics at UW-Madison.

This project was completed in ArcGIS Pro 3.1. The notebooks here use the arcpy module to automate geoprocessing tasks in ArcGIS Pro, so an ArcGIS Pro license is necessary to run the scripts unmodified.

For project details, data sources, and methodology, see the [project website](https://assessing-equitable-recreation-access-uw-mad.hub.arcgis.com/).
